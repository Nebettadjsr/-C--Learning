# Temperature Converter (C# Practice Project)

This is a small **C# console project** I created to practice basic programming concepts while learning C# on my own.

### Features:
- Convert temperatures between **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**
- Input validation to prevent crashes

### Purpose:
This project is part of my **self-taught C# learning journey**.  
Since I used an **online compiler** for this exercise, the code is provided as a **single `.cs` file** without a full `.NET` project structure.
