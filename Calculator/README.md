# Simple Calculator (C# Practice Project)

This is a small **C# console calculator** project I built to strengthen my knowledge of:

- **User input**
- **Switch statements**
- **Loops**
- **Basic error handling**
- **Functions in C#**

### Features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Division by zero handling
- Input validation and loop for continuous calculations

### Purpose:
This is part of my **self-guided C# learning process**.  
The code was developed in an **online compiler**, so it is provided as a **standalone `.cs` file** without full project scaffolding.
